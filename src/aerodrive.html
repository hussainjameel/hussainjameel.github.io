      <div class="col-lg-12 my-5 px-lg-5">
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Purpose and Goal</h5>
        <p>
          In our final year at university, my friend
          <a class="black-link" href="https://github.com/AbdulRafey612"
            >@AbdulRafey612</a
          >
          and I collaborated on this project. Choosing this project was driven
          by our shared passion for web development and the desire to delve into
          a multitude of essential concepts and technologies relevant to the
          field. We were eager to create a practical web-based solution that
          would not only meet the needs of users but also showcase our
          proficiency as web developers. The result of our efforts is a
          cutting-edge web-based solution, designed to provide a platform for
          users to store, manage, and access their files online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from the familiarity of a desktop interface,
          Aerodrive was designed with efficiency in mind. We incorporated
          powerful file management capabilities, allowing users to easily
          organize their files into folders and apply relevant metadata.
          Searching and retrieving specific files became a breeze, boosting
          productivity and reducing time spent on file management tasks. To
          enhance the versatility of Aerodrive, we integrated essential
          third-party applications that complemented its core functionality.
          This integration expanded the application's capabilities, including
          collaborative tools.

        <h5 class="sub-heading mt-5">Some Goodies</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using Vite with React brings numerous benefits to web development.
            It offers lightning-fast development and Hot Module Replacement
            (HMR), enabling real-time changes without page reloads. The
            optimized build process reduces bundle sizes, improving loading
            times and overall application performance.
          </li>

          <li class="my-3">
            This was my first time that I was using a utility-first approach for
            designing. I found that this approach offers a minimal and optimized
            CSS output, resulting in faster loading times. Using Unocss with
            React brings several benefits to your frontend development. Unocss's
            highly customizable nature empowers developers to tailor the styles
            according to their specific project requirements, you can
            efficiently style components with small utility classes, leading to
            a more streamlined and efficient styling process.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="sub-heading mt-5">Lessons Learnt</h5>
        <p>
          During the development of Aerodrive, we encountered valuable lessons
          that profoundly impacted our growth as web developers. One of the key
          takeaways was the significance of effectively managing and displaying
          changing data within the application. Incorporating real-time updates
          and dynamic content required us to explore AJAX and WebSockets,
          enabling us to deliver a seamless user experience with up-to-date
          information. Additionally, as Aerodrive aimed to serve multiple users,
          we faced the challenge of handling their data securely and
          efficiently. Designing a robust user authentication and authorization
          system, along with implementing concurrency control mechanisms,
          ensured data privacy and consistency. Throughout the project, we also
          emphasized the value of user-centric design. The journey of creating
          Aerodrive taught us the power of collaboration, both in technical
          aspects and team dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we came across MinIO object storage, in which files are
          dispersed across hardware in a flat structure called as object
          storage, commonly referred to as object-based storage. Instead of
          being maintained as files in directories or as blocks on servers, the
          data is divided up into discrete parts called objects and kept in a
          single repository with object storage. Using Minio for file storage
          offers several significant benefits over file-level and block storage.
          To further explore the various types of storage options available, you
          can refer to the comprehensive guide provided by
